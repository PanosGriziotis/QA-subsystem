Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. 3. Where do coronaviruses come from? Coronaviruses can infect and circulate among different animal species, such as pigs, cats or dogs. Some groups of coronaviruses also circulate among humans and cause seasonal epidemics, mostly during the winter months. Coronaviruses that circulate among humans are thought to originate from animal reservoirs.

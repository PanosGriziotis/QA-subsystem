Current recommendations for COVID-19 clinical management in people living with HIV generally do not differ from those of the general population, including treatment and prevention measures. PLHIV are as eligible to receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies as people without HIV infection and those individuals with advanced HIV disease should be considered as a high priority.When starting treatment for COVID-19 in patients with HIV, clinicians should pay careful attention to potential interactions between drugs and overlapping toxicities among COVID-19 treatments, antiretrovirals (ARV), antimicrobial therapies, and other medications. PLHIV who develop COVID-19 should continue their ARV regimen, opportunistic infection treatment and prophylaxis whenever possible. The ARV regimen should not be switched or adjusted (i.e., by adding ARV drugs to the regimen) for the purpose of preventing or treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.Individuals who know their HIV status are advised to take the same COVID-19 precautions as the general population (e.g., wash hands often, practice cough hygiene, avoid touching your face, social distancing, seek medical care if symptomatic, self-isolation if in contact with someone with COVID-19 and other actions recommended in the governmentâ€™s response). PLHIV who are taking ARV drugs should ensure that they have at least 30 days of ARVs, if not a 3- to 6-month supply.It is also an important opportunity to ensure that all PLHIV who are not yet on antiretroviral treatment begin to do so.  People who feel they may have been at HIV risk are advised to seek testing to protect against HIV disease progression and complications from any other health issues.

Many ethical frameworks have been produced for resource allocation, some of which havebeen included in pandemic plans. Those frameworks provide useful guidance in the currentscenario. Yet, when applying them, we must take into account the type of health careresource, the context, and the stage of the pandemic. That is, while the ethical principles thatapply to resource allocation might be the same in different pandemics, they can lead todifferent decisions, given contextual circumstances. For example, this pandemic appears tosignificantly impact older adults (those 60 years of age or older), and such characteristics arerelevant to shaping priorities for the allocation of resources during COVID-19. As a result, itmay be inappropriate to use critical care triage guidelines that have age cut-offs thatdeprioritize or exclude those aged over 60 years.When applying ethical guidelines for resource allocation, we should consider the extent towhich resources are overwhelmed in the current context. It would be inappropriate, forinstance, to exclude population groups from being allocated a resource (for example,ventilators) at the outset of a pandemic when capacity remains. When resources are scarce,though – when there is an insufficient supply to meet everyone’s needs – resource allocationshould be guided by well established, broadly applicable ethical principles, unless there arecharacteristics of the outbreak that justify different courses of action. Irrelevantcharacteristics of populations within countries, such as ethnicity, race or creed, should playno role in any resource allocation in any pandemic. This reflects our commitment to treatingpeople with equal respect.

Comprehensive contact tracing should be implemented each time cases or clusters (groups of linked cases) are identified. During intense transmission, contact tracing capacities may be overwhelmed, so contact tracing     activities may  focus on household contacts, healthcare workerscontacts, contacts in high-risk closed settings (such as dormitories, institutions, long-term living facilities),and contacts at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. It is important to maintain contact tracing and quarantine of contacts even when the number of new cases may be decreasing, and/or public health and social measures may be being relaxed, in order to ensure that transmission continues to reduce.

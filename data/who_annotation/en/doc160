In rare situations where a serious adverse reaction is suspected to be related to the vaccine itself, the vaccine may be temporarily suspended from use while the situation is assessed. Investigations will take place to determine what exactly caused the event, and corrective measures will be put in place. WHO works closely with vaccine manufacturers, health officials, researchers, and other partners to monitor any safety concerns and potential side effects.Vaccine recalls or withdrawals due to safety issues are rare. Recalls are generally associated with problems identified during the monitoring of batches of vaccines through quality control systems, stability studies and reports from the field, including cold chain issues where some vaccines have not been stored at the right conditions and so are no longer safe or effective. In this case, people who have received a vaccine from that batch may need to be vaccinated again to ensure they are protected. This is why vaccines are so closely monitored â€“ to ensure that any issues with their production, storage or use can be rapidly identified and resolved.

Rapid antigen tests (sometimes known as a rapid diagnostic test â€“ RDT) detect viral proteins (known as antigens). Samples are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab. These tests are cheaper than PCR and will offer results more quickly, although they are generally less accurate. These tests perform best when there is more virus circulating in the community and when sampled from an individual during the time they are most infectious. - Learn more about rapid diagnostic test

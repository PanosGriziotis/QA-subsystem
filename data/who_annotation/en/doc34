There are very few conditions that would exclude someone from being vaccinated, but you should NOT be vaccinated if: You have a history of severe allergic reactions/anaphylaxis to any of the ingredients of the COVID-19 vaccine, in order to avoid possible adverse effects.You have a fever over 38.5oC on the day of your vaccine appointment. Postpone until you have recovered. You currently have confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Wait until you have completed the mandated isolation period and your acute symptoms have passed to get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccines are safe for people taking blood thinners, but you should let the person giving you the vaccine know about any medication you are taking BEFORE you are given the vaccine. In addition to the general recommendations above, each vaccine may have specific considerations for specific populations and health conditions. Talk to your doctor for advice about your specific situation.

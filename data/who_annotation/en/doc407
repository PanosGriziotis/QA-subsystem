Know before you go. Some venues, destinations and countries require COVID-19 tests prior to departure or upon arrival as part of their strategies to prevent the spread of disease. COVID-19 tests conducted immediately prior to departure or on arrival are used in an effort to determine the health status of travellers. As always, continue wearing a mask, washing hands frequently, maintaining physical distance of at least 1 metre, and avoiding crowded places and poorly ventilated settings whenever possible.Every destination has its own policies, so itâ€™s important to be aware of testing requirements before you hit the road.

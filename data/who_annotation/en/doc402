People in certain groups – including those over the age of 60, those with chronic illnesses, and those with underlying health conditions – face increased risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. If you are in a high-risk group, you should consider the risk carefully before you make travel plans.Be sure to follow COVID-19 prevention measures, such as wearing a mask, washing hands frequently, maintaining physical distance of at least 1 metre, and avoiding crowded places and poorly ventilated settings whenever possible. If you are in a high-risk group and must travel, wear a medical-grade face mask at all times and step up your prevention practices. People aged 60 and over, and those with serious chronic diseases or underlying health conditions, should postpone or delay travel internationally to and from areas with community transmission unless they have been fully vaccinated at least two weeks prior to their travel, or have immunity from a recent infection within 6 months prior to travelling.  People in high-risk groups are at a greater risk of getting very sick or dying after getting COVID-19.

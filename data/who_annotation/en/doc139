Health care workers (caring for patients) and first responders can justifiably beprioritized when allocating some resources because of their contribution to the healthand well-being of the community. Their health helps preserve the health of others.Participants of research aimed at developing vaccines, therapies or other criticalresources should receive some priority in receiving those resources because they havealso helped save others by their participation. This is not an absolute priority â€“ forexample, it should not take precedence over giving priority to those most at risk in thecase of resources such as vaccines.While the principle of first come, first served is often applied when allocatingresources in health care settings, it is rarely appropriate in an emergency. In practice,it is very likely to favour certain groups, such as those closest to a distribution centre,those with access to better information, or those who are most well-off.Younger populations appear to be at lower risk in the COVID-19 context.Consequently, the principle of youngest first should have low priority for vaccine, butperhaps may have more weight if they do become sick and need critical careresources.The allocation of different resources may find ethical justification in differentprinciples or values. For instance, if a novel vaccine is found to be safe and effective,a lottery-based allocation may be justified among those as highest risk, the old andthose with co-morbidities, if they outnumber available vaccines.Maximizing utility should be balanced with the principle of priority to the worst-off:centralizing the availability of resources in larger centres may extend their benefits tomore people, but may exclude isolated populations and challenge our concern forthose at highest risk.

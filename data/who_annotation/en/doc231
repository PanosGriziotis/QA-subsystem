In order to determine age-sex patterns of excess deaths, countries are categorized into eight groups using a K-means clustering approach. While a natural grouping would be geographically representative, using some regional identification (e.g., WHO regions), from a practical perspective it is not always possible owing to insufficient availability of empirical data in some countries or regions. Even within close geographic proximity, the impact of the pandemic, and its magnitude by sex and age can vary significantly. K-means is a method commonly used to characterize data and partition a data set into groups. Countries are grouped into clusters based on mean ages at death and of population, as well as the overall excess mortality rates and porportion of total deaths. The number of clusters is chosen to maximise the variation between clusters and to minimise the variation within clusters by age and sex. More details on the K-means clustering are provided in the methodology.

Conventions, framework agreements and treaties are all examples of international instruments, which are legal agreements made between countries that are binding.  There are international instruments addressing a broad range of topics, including tobacco control, nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, climate change and many other threats to our shared security and well-being.A key international instrument on international health, rooted in the WHO Constitution, is the International Health Regulations (2005), which was established “to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade”.

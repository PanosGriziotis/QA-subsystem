We are still learning about how long immunity to COVID-19 lasts from natural infection, and from vaccination. We are now starting to see evidence that the immunity you get after having COVID-19 can be strong. However, the type of immunity that's developed after infection varies from person to person, making it less predictable than immunity after vaccination. Scientists are working hard to understand this better.What we do know is that COVID-19 is a life-threatening disease that can have long-term consequences. We also know that the WHO-authorised COVID-19 vaccines have been safely given to billions of people. It is much safer to get vaccinated than it is to risk getting COVID-19. Get vaccinated as soon as itâ€™s your turn and keep doing everything you can to protect yourself and others.As we learn more about COVID-19 and immunity, WHO continues to update our guidance and recommendations.

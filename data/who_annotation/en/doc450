Transmission of the virus while your baby is in the womb or during birth is possible, but very rare. Most babies wonâ€™t develop COVID-19 disease, and those who develop symptoms tend to recover quickly. Babies can be infected after birth, so if you do get COVID-19, it is important for you and other caregivers to take all precautions to reduce the risks of passing the virus to the baby. Babies can be placed skin-to-skin and breastfed if the mother is confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19. The numerous benefits of skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks of transmission and illness associated with COVID-19.

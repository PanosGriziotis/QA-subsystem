While WHO is working with countries to ensure fair and equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, it is important to continue actions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission and to reduce COVID-19 deaths. Alongside the response to COVID-19, it is critical to maintain access to essential health services. This includes:supporting PLHIV to continue taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and adapting services to make this easier and more efficient during the COVID-19 response;continuing to provide HIV prevention and testing services with linkage to ART initiation as a priority;ensuring those who start ART can remain on it to reduce health risks and complications during COVID-19. This must be classified as an essential service, together with prevention, diagnosis and treatment of co-morbidities and co-infections; andmonitoring all PLHIV and SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially those with advanced HIV disease or with co-morbidities.Although there may be an increase in the risk of developing severe disease from COVID-19 among PLHIV, making sure that people have access to effective ART and other health care services they need will help minimize this risk.

Excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is used to quantify the direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic. Excess mortality is defined as the difference between the total number of deaths estimated for a specific place and given time period and the number that would have been expected in the absence of a crisis (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic). This difference is assumed to include deaths attributable directly to COVID-19 as well as deaths indirectly associated with COVID-19 through impacts on health systems and society, minus any deaths that would have occurred under normal circumstances but were averted due to pandemic-related changes in social conditions and personal behaviours. Estimates of the excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic includes deaths from all causes. In certain locations, these estimates may include excess deaths associated with other crises such as extreme weather, disasters, or conflicts.

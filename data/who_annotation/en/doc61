You should get vaccinated if you are menstruating. If you have your period on the day of your vaccination appointment, you can go ahead and get vaccinated. Menstruation isnâ€™t a medical reason to not get the COVID-19 vaccine. If you have concerns or questions about your periods, do not hesitate to speak with your health care provider.

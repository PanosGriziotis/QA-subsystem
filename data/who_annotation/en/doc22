For the purpose of discussing variants in the media and the public, WHO began using the Greek alphabet in May of 2021 to make it easier for people to keep track of variants without linking their names to the places where they were first identified, as variants can emerge anywhere at any time.In accordance with WHO best practices for naming new diseases, some letters may not be used if they cause confusion in major languages or stigmatize certain groups. These WHO labels do not replace the existing scientific names of the variants, which convey important scientific information to researchers and scientists.

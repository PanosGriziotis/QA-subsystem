You should follow national advice and the advice of the countries you are travelling to and from.  Some countries are allowing fully vaccinated people to avoid quarantine and testing on arrival. This is because these individuals are at a lower risk of COVID-19 and are less likely to get infected and pass the virus to others. But even once you are fully vaccinated, continue to practice the same prevention measures – no vaccine is 100% effective, and doing it all helps protect yourself and others. Stay at least 1 metre away from other people, wear a properly fitted mask over your nose and mouth when you can’t keep this distance, avoid poorly ventilated places and settings, clean your hands frequently, stay home if unwell and get tested, and stay informed about how much virus is circulating in the areas where you travel, live and work. WHO does not support using proof of vaccination as a requirement for international travel. This would not be fair, given that there are not enough vaccines for everyone, and that some countries have more access to vaccines than others.

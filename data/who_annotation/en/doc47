Yes. The maximum level of protection from COVID-19 vaccines is not reached until several weeks after full vaccination. If you have a two-dose vaccine, this means that you don’t get full immunity until 2 – 4 weeks after the second dose. You can still become infected and ill during this time. While COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against serious illness, hospitalisation and death, no vaccine is 100% effective. As a result, a number of vaccinated people will get infected and may fall ill with COVID-19 in spite of being fully vaccinated. This is known as a ‘breakthrough infection’ or ‘breakthrough case’. With more infectious virus variants such as Delta, we are seeing more breakthrough infections and cases. Breakthrough infections can happen with every vaccine, and do not mean that the vaccine does not work. According to data from the US CDC, unvaccinated people are at 11 times the risk of death from COVID-19 than vaccinated people. People who get COVID-19 after being vaccinated are much more likely to only experience mild symptoms; efficacy against serious illness and death remains high. Get vaccinated, as soon as it’s your turn. Even once you are fully vaccinated, continue to practice the same prevention measures to protect yourself. Stay at least 1 metre away from other people, wear a well fitted mask over your nose and mouth when you can’t keep this distance, avoid poorly ventilated places and settings, clean your hands frequently, stay home if unwell and get tested and stay informed about how much virus is circulating in the areas where you travel, live and work.

 In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no “zero risk” when it comes to any kind of gathering – especially events that bring groups of people together. Regardless of the size of the event, you are at risk from COVID-19 whenever you get together with people. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads easily indoors, especially in poorly ventilated settings.  If you don’t feel well or show any symptoms of COVID-19, stay home. If you choose to attend a gathering, practice prevention measures, regardless of your COVID-19 vaccination status:  keep at least a 1 metre distance from others;wear a mask; avoid crowded or poorly ventilated areas; cover coughs and sneezes with bent elbow or tissues; and  clean your hands frequently.  These measures are a good idea to protect yourself and others, even when the event or venue doesn’t require you to practice them.

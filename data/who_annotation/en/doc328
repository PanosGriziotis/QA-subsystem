It is wrong for anyone to do this. And it is not your fault in any way. If you are staying in the same house as the person and/or are dependent on him (it will usually be a man), that may make some of the things that you could do difficult, especially during stay-at-home restrictions due to COVID-19. Here are some things that you can consider doing to improve your safety while in the house.You could tell him politely but firmly that you do not want him to touch you and ask him to please stop.You could inform your parents or other caregivers or trusted adult in the house about what is happening.You could inform a trusted adult outside your home such as a neighbour or a teacher or family friend or relative.If you have access to a phone, you could call or text for help and support. This includes calling hotlines/helplines for children and women who are in need of help or feeling distressed or subjected to abuse, or calling a child protection service in your area. Be careful not to leave your phone calls or text messages where anyone else could access them. If you need to leave the house immediately because he is hurting or harming you, think of discretely (without him overhearing) pre-arranging with a neighbour or trusted relative or family friend to help you leave the house and stay with them until it is safe for you to return home. If you have been sexually abused or raped and need urgent medical help or care, go as soon as possible to the nearest hospital or clinic to ask for medical care.

In December 2021, WHO’s Member States requested the WHO Director-General to convene the meetings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body and support its work, including by facilitating the participation of other United Nations system bodies, non-state actors, and other relevant stakeholders in the process to the extent decided by the 194 Member States forming part of the negotiations.The WHO Secretariat’s job is to support countries – its Member States – as they negotiate and agree on the new international accord. The WHO Secretariat does not determine the contents of any possible international accord.

People with compromised immune systems donâ€™t always develop maximum immunity against COVID-19 after one or two doses, so may need an additional dose to protect them. WHO recommends that people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised should be offered an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine.For Sinovac and Sinopharm, WHO recommends that countries should consider offering a third dose of the vaccine to the vaccination schedule for those aged 60 and over as an extension of the primary series, once a high level of coverage of first and second doses has been achieved in the priority groups.An additional dose is different from a booster dose. It is considered part of an extended primary series for people who do not develop sufficient protection after one or two doses. It is intended to help these individuals to develop better protection against COVID-19.

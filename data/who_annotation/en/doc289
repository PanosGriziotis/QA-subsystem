There are now more than 200 peer-reviewed publications,  pre-prints,  manuscripts and government reports of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies. These studies vary in study design, populations under study, serologic tests used, timing of sample collection, and quality. Overall, the population-based seroprevalence reported across available studies remains low, at below 10%.Some studies conducted in areas of known high virus transmission and studies of health care workers in areas of known high transmission have reported seroprevalence estimates over 20%.Available study results indicate that, globally, most people remain susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

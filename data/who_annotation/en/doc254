The International Health Regulations (2005) (the “IHR”) are a key international instrument on international health, rooted in the WHO Constitution. The IHR were established to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. The work on the new accord on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response would aim to be coherent with, and complement, the IHR. The IHR are also under a process, established by the 194 Member States forming part of the World Health Assembly in May 2022, of potential “targeted” amendments, through a separate Member-State led Working Group process which will hold its first organizational meeting no later than 15 November 2022.

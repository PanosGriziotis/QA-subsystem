Negative excess deaths could be observed if deaths that would have happened in the absence of the pandemic were averted due to measures taken to deal with the pandemic. Some public health measures (e.g., lockdown, social distancing, mask wearing, working from home) have led to decrease in the number of deaths from causes other than COVID-19. For instance, a decreased number of deaths due to road traffic injuries and seasonal flu has been observed due to restricted movement of people.

If you feel yourself getting angry or very annoyed, step away into another room if you can, or outside for a deep breath.  Count to ten and breathe in and out until you feel calmer. Count down from 10, or do anything else that may help you stay calm. Talk to a trusted friend, relative, or religious leader and if necessary seek help from local health services or specialized services if available.  Recognize that everyone in your family is experiencing stress during this time. Demonstrate kindness and patience in your words and actions.  Eliminate or reduce your alcohol consumption as much as possible. The current measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic, such as restrictions on movement, as well as financial instability caused by the crisis, are likely to add to your stress.  This is normal, and you can control how you react.  Take measures to ensure you manage your stress in a way that is respectful and safe to you and your family. Try to be kind to yourself, your partner, children and anyone else in the family.

Losing someone close to you is always hard, whatever the cause. During these extraordinary circumstances, when your usual routine may be disrupted and when funerals may not be permitted, it may be even harder. Following this advice may help. Do not criticise yourself for how you feel. When you lose a family member or friend to COVID-19, you may experience a range of emotions.  You may also have difficulty sleeping or low levels of energy. All these feelings are normaland there is no right or wrong way to feel grief. Allow yourself time to process your emotions in response to your loss. You may think that the sadness and pain that you feel will never go away, but in most cases, these feelings lessen over time. Talk regularly with people that you trust about your feelings. Keep to your routines as much as you feel able and try to focus on activities that bring you joy. Seek advice and comfort from people that you trust (e.g. religious/faith leaders, mental health workers or other trusted members of your community) while maintaining physical distance (e.g. attending virtual mass).    Think of alternative ways to say goodbye to the person who passed away such as writing a letter or dedicating a drawing to your loved one. These are small actions that can help you cope with grief and loss, particularly in situations where funeral services are not permitted

A near-constant stream of news, sometimes contradictory, can cause anyone to feel lost and distressed. Make sure to use reliable sources such as UNICEF and WHO’s sites to get information, or to check any information you might be getting through less reliable channels.If you have a phone, you can use the WHO Health Alert on WhatsApp to get the latest information about the pandemic. This is a new service, which is free to use, designed to give prompt, reliable and official information 24 hours a day, worldwide. Start by clicking the WHO Health Alert, then simply text the word ‘Hi’ in a WhatsApp message to get started. Many countries have similar initiatives to provide context-specific information and updates. Keep in mind that overloading yourself with information about the COVID-19 pandemic can also be stressful, so seek information updates and practical guidance at specific times during the day and avoid listening to or following rumours that make you feel uncomfortable.Find out more on our Mythbusters pageFind out more on our #HealthyAtHome - Mental health page.

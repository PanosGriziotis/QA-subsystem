WHO continues to coordinate with a large number of researchers around the world to understand more about all variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, including Omicron. Many studies are needed, including assessments of: Transmissibility, or ease of spread from person to person, of Omicron as compared to other variantsSeverity of infection and re-infection with OmicronPerformance of current COVID-19 vaccines against OmicronPerformance of diagnostic tests, including antigen tests, to detect infection with OmicronEffectiveness of current treatments for management of patients with COVID-19 diseaseWHOâ€™s Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution will continue to monitor and evaluate the data as it becomes available and assess if mutations in the Omicron variant alter the behaviour of the virus.

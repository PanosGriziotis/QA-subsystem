If someone is sick and being cared for at home, the following can be done to improve ventilation and reduce the risk of infection to other members of the household:Whenever possible, the ill person should stay in a separate room. If this is not possible, then keep at least a 1-metre distance from them. The sick person and anyone else in the same room should wear a medical mask.Provide good ventilation in the room of the ill person and shared spaces, and open windows whenever possible.Create a cross breeze by opening windows or doors on opposite sides of the ill person’s room.If possible, try to prevent the air from moving from the sick person’s room to the rest of the house. If available, the ill person should stay in a separate room that has a private toilet with an air extractor or exhaust fan, which should run at a high speed.As a supplement, you can use a stand-alone air cleaner with a MERV14/ISO ePM1 70-80% air filter. MERV14/F8 filter. These devices may improve air quality but are not a replacement for ventilation.Also see  WHO’s Q&A on homecare .

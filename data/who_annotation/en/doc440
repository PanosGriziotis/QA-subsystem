No ARVs are currently recommended by WHO to treat or prevent COVID-19. Initial in vitro, animal and small human observational studies conducted during previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS and MERS) and in the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic have suggested that some ARVs, such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), could help against SARS-CoV-2 and should be repurposed for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. This hypothesis was subsequently assessed in further observational studies and in large randomized controlled trials, but no clinical benefit or impact on disease severity or mortality were demonstrated (2).   Several observational studies also indicated that use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) could be associated with lower risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 and develop severe COVID-19. However, these studies had limitations and may have been influenced by other health issues in the participants.. Subsequent larger observational studies and clinical trials have not found a relationship between TDF or TAF and risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition or severe outcomes.   While the evidence of benefit of using ARVs to treat coronavirus infections was not demonstrated, serious side effects from these drugs were not rare. The routine use of LPV/r and TDF or TAF as part of treatment regimens for HIV can be associated with several side effects of moderate severity. Therefore, at this time there is no evidence to suggest that any particular ARV agent improves or worsens COVID-19 clinical outcomes in PLHIV, or can be used for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. WHO recommends maintaining the standard approaches to initiation and continuation of ART in PLHIV, with a focus on reducing HIV-associated immune compromise and achievement of virologic suppression. The same principles are applicable for use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PreP) or post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimens for HIV prevention.

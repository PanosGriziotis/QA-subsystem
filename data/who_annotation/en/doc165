As with any vaccine, it is essential to closely monitor the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that are used in immunization programmes. If a serious health problem is reported following vaccination, a thorough investigation should take place by the public health programme in the country.It is rare to find that health problems occurring following receipt of a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself. Health problems following vaccination are most often found to be coincidental and entirely unrelated to vaccination. Sometimes they are related to how the vaccine has been stored, transported, or administered. Errors related to the delivery of the vaccine can be prevented by better training health workers and strengthening supply chains.The results of the investigation will then inform next steps. The safety of COVID-19 vaccines is the top priority of the World Health Organization. Find out more about how the safety of vaccines is monitored.

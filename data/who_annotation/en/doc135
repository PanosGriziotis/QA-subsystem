Generally, the considerations may be different. The allocation of different resources may findethical justifications in different principles or values. For instance, once a novel vaccine isfound to be safe and effective, to prioritize those at highest risk, as well as populations likehealth care workers who may be more likely to serve as vectors for transmission, is justified.Within those subgroups, some suggest that a lottery-based (i.e., random) allocation may bejustified, given that resources will be limited and we can assume nearly equal benefits will bederived from any recipient within that group. This is not the case, however, for otherresources such as ventilators, where some individuals may derive significantly more benefitthan others.

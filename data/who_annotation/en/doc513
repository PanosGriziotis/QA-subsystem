WHO recommends that all patients, even those without diabetes, should have their blood sugar monitored since corticosteroids can increase blood glucose levels. Certain patients should be monitored closely when receiving corticosteroids since they are at increased risk of developing complications. These include people with diabetes, cancer, open wounds following traumatic injuries, severe burns, or malnourishment. Patients taking immunosuppressants/immunomodulators, with severe immunodeficiencies should also be monitored along with intravenous drug users.

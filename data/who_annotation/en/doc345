Masks are a key measure to reduce transmission and save lives.Wearing well-fitted masks should be used as part of a comprehensive ‘Do it all!’ approach including maintaining physical distancing, avoiding crowded, closed and close-contact settings, ensuring good ventilation of indoor spaces, cleaning hands regularly, and covering sneezes and coughs with a tissue of bent elbow.Depending on the type, masks can be used for either protection of healthy persons or to prevent onward transmission, or both.

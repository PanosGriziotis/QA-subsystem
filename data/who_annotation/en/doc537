In general, children aged 5 years and under do not need to wear masks. However, there may be times when caregivers will choose to put a mask on a child â€“ for example, if the child has contact with a person who is at a high risk of developing severe disease or is around someone who is ill. Children of this age should not wear masks for a long duration or without supervision.

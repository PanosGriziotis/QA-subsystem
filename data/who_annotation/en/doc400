People with symptoms of COVID-19 – including fever, cough, or shortness of breath – should not travel.  If you are showing symptoms of COVID-19, stay home and isolate yourself away from other people. If you have been around someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, isolate yourself, follow the guidance of local authorities and watch for symptoms. People in certain groups – including those over the age of 60, those with chronic illnesses, and those with underlying health conditions – face increased risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. If you are in one of these groups but have not been fully vaccinated and do not have immunity from a recent previous COVID-19 infection, consider postponing travel to areas with widespread COVID-19

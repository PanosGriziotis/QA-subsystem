Pregnant women do not seem to be at higher risk of getting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, studies have shown an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 if they are infected, compared with non-pregnant women of a similar age. COVID-19 during pregnancy has also been associated with an increased likelihood of preterm birth. Pregnant women who are older, overweight or have pre-existing medical conditions such as hypertension (high blood pressure) and diabetes are at particular risk of serious outcomes of COVID-19.  It is important that pregnant women – and those around them – take precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19. If they become unwell (including with fever, cough or difficulty breathing), they should seek urgent medical advice from a health worker.

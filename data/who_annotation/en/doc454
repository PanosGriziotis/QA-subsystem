Yes, pregnant women can be vaccinated against COVID-19.   COVID-19 vaccines offer strong protection against severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Vaccination during pregnancy is important whenever there is risk of the disease, but especially for frontline health workers, people living in areas where there is high community transmission, and those with health conditions like hypertension (high blood pressure) and diabetes that add to risk of severe disease.   Some evidence also suggests that babies may receive protective benefits from the vaccine, in addition to the benefits for pregnant women.Pregnant women in many countries around the world have now received COVID-19 vaccines, and no safety concerns have been identified related to their pregnancies or the health of their babies. None of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized to date use live viruses, which are more likely to pose risks during pregnancy.

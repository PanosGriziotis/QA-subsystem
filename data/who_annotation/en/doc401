As part of public health efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19, travel may be limited or restricted to travel deemed to be essential. Essential travel is defined differently by national authorities in different countries. Essential travel may include travel for emergencies and humanitarian activities (including emergency medical flights and medical evacuation). It may include travel taken by essential personnel (including emergency responders and those who provide public health technical support, and critical personnel in transport and security sectors, such as seafarers and diplomatic officers). Essential travel may also include repatriations to home countries, as well as cargo transport needed to deliver essential supplies such as food, medicines, and fuel. WHO encourages national authorities to facilitate travel for essential reasons at all times.

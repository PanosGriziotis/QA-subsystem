In February 2021, in collaboration with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), WHO convened a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on COVID-19 Mortality Assessment to advise on the development of analytical methods for estimating excess mortality in all countries. The COVID TAG is comprised of leading demographers, epidemiologists, data and social scientists and statisticians from a range of backgrounds and geographies.Under Working Group I of the TAG (Working Group I: Global excess mortality estimates including COVID-19), members considered several statistical models and after assessing performance, interpretability as well as extensibility, the TAG proposed a Poisson regression model (parameterized to account for over-dispersion) to predict the total number of deaths from all causes for the years 2020 and 2021, conditional on the monthly expected deaths over the period and a predicted relative rate parameter which is modelled using country-specific variables.The model has been used by WHO to generate estimates for countries and regions for which adequate input data were available for reliable inference and to predict estimates for countries with no data available. In addition to determining levels of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic for the years 2020 and 2021, the expertise of the TAG is also being leveraged to develop methods for disaggregating the estimated number of excess deaths by age and sex.WHOâ€™s estimates are produced following the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER).

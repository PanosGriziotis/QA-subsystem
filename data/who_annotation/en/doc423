Yes. All modern methods of contraception are safe to use, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If you have had a baby in the last six months or have a health condition, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or breast cancer – or if you smoke – seek advice from a health care professional to ensure you are using a method of contraception which is suitable and safe for you.

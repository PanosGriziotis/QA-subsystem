In rare instances, patients receiving casirivimab and imdevimab can develop severe allergic reactions. If this occurs, appropriate medical therapy should be initiated immediately. This is why it is important for patients to receive this medication in the presence of a healthcare professional in a monitored clinical setting. Infusion-related reactions are rare and may occur while receiving the infusion or up to 24 hours after completion. If during the infusion a severe or life-threatening reaction occurs, the infusion may be given more slowly or stopped. Signs of an infusion-related reaction include fever, difficulty breathing, reduced oxygenation, chills, fatigue, irregular heartbeat, chest pain or discomfort, weakness, nausea, headache, angioedema (swelling of the lips), throat irritation, hypertension (high blood pressure), hypotension (low blood pressure), throat irritation, rash, tching, muscle aches, feeling faint, passing out, dizziness, and diaphoresis (sweating).

There is no evidence that the safety or effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines is affected by anything you eat or drink before or after getting vaccinated, including alcohol. However, drinking alcohol can add to the normal mild to moderate side effects that you might experience after vaccination, such as a headache and tiredness. Because of this, it is advisable to avoid drinking until any side effects following vaccination have passed. Learn more about the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines. While COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing serious illness and death, there is still a chance you could be infected after being vaccinated. Continue to protect yourself and others by continuing to practice physical distancing, wear a well-fitted mask over your nose and mouth, clean your hands frequently, stay home if you feel unwell, cover coughs and sneezes and keep indoor spaces well ventilated. Drinking alcohol may make you less vigilant in practicing these behaviours and so can put you and others at risk. Please keep in mind that drinking alcohol can increase your risk of other health problems.

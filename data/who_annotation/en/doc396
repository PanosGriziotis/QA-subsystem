All patients receiving tocilizumab or sarilumab should be clinically monitored by a healthcare provider before, during, and after receiving an infusion. The patient should also receive optimal standard of care for COVID-19, which includes oxygen therapy. Certain patients who received IL-6 receptor blockers may be at a higher risk for complications and need to be monitored closely. These include patients receiving concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, those with recurring chronic infections or underlying conditions that predispose them to infection, and who are on long-term IL-6 receptor blockers for chronic medical conditions.

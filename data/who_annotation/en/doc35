Yes. Even if you have already had COVID-19, you should be vaccinated. The protection that someone gains from having COVID-19 will vary greatly from person to person. The immunity people get from being vaccinated after having a natural infection is consistently very strong. Getting vaccinated even if you have had COVID-19 means you are more likely to be protected for longer.There is currently no evidence to determine the optimal time that you should wait to be vaccinated after having COVID-19. Persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection can consider delaying vaccination for 6 months based on the fact that natural infection leads to some protection against infection. Ask your health worker for advice.

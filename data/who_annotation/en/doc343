Everyone has a part to play to bring COVID-19 under control, and contact tracing begins with informed, engaged and enabled communities. Understand the local public health and social measures and collaborate with health authorities for case and contact investigation. Agree to monitoring, report signs or symptoms of COVID-19 promptly, and be prepared to quarantine or go into isolation if you become a confirmedcase of COVID-19.        In addition, you can, while respecting physical distancing and all other protective measures, provide support to relatives or friends who have to be isolated or undertake quarantine. Check in on them by phone or offer to bring supplies to their house, if needed. Transmission of the COVID-19 virus can only be stopped if we all play our role to protect our family, friends and community.

WHO and its partners are committed to accelerating the development of COVID-19 vaccines while maintaining the highest standards on safety.Vaccines go through various phases of development and testing – there are usually three phases to clinical trials, with the last one designed to assess the ability of the product to protect against disease, which is called efficacy. All phases assess safety. The last phase, phase III, are usually conducted in a large number of people, often 10’s of thousands.  After that, the vaccine needs to go through a review by the national regulatory authority, who will decide if the vaccine is safe and effective enough to be put on the market, and a policy committee, who will decide how the vaccine should be used.       In the past, vaccines have been developed through a series of consecutive steps that can take many years. Now, given the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, unprecedented financial investments and scientific collaborations are changing how vaccines are developed. This means that some of the steps in the research and development process have been happening in parallel, while still maintaining strict clinical and safety standards. For example, some clinical trials are evaluating multiple vaccines at the same time. It is the scale of the financial and political commitments to the development of a vaccine that has allowed this accelerated development to take place. However, this does not make the studies any less rigorous.The more vaccines in development the more opportunities there are for success. Any longer-term safety assessment will be conducted through continued follow up of the clinical trial participants, as well as through specific studies and general pharmacovigilance of those being vaccinated in the roll out.  This represents standard practise for all newly authorized vaccines.More information about COVID-19 vaccine development is available here.

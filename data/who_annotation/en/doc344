Yes, providing accurate information when requested is important to successful contact tracing activities. National authorities may ask incoming travelers to report their health status at the time of travel, possible exposures to confirmed or probable COVID-19 cases within the previous two weeks, and to provide their contact details so they can be located for health monitoring or international contact tracing purposes. Authorities may also require arriving passengers to download and use a national COVID-19 digital proximity tracing app on arrival.  Please consult national authorities/airline companies to verify details before you travel.

It is safe for you to receive two different COVID-19 vaccines for your first and second dose. This is sometimes called mixing and matching vaccines, or a heterologous vaccine schedule. WHO considers two doses of any WHO EUL COVID-19 vaccines to be a complete primary series. See the full list of COVID-19 vaccines with WHO EUL here. By mixing and matching vaccines, countries are able to maximise vaccine impact in the event of constrained or limited supply. People over 60 who have received two doses of Sinovac and Sinopharm can also be given a third dose to help boost their immunity, once a high level of coverage of the priority groups has been achieved. SAGE has stated that Pfizer or AstraZeneca can be used for the third dose if the original vaccine is not available. Further trials are underway to understand more about mixed doses, which will inform any future changes to WHOâ€™s recommendations.

Backward contact tracing refers to the process of trying to understand how the case became infected, also known as case or source investigation. While traditional contact tracing identifies people who were exposed to cases and may become cases themselves, backward contact tracing or source investigation looks back in time to identify settings or events where exposure to the virus may have occurred. This may help public health authorities identify more cases (such as at an event or setting where the case may have been infected) and identify settings that have led to infection. This can inform the development of targeted public health and social measures to reduce the overall number of cases.

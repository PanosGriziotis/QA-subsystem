In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no “zero risk” when it comes to gathering with others, but there are many ways in which you can reduce the risk of infection and spread of the COVID-19 virus. In general, you are at risk of COVID-19 infection whenever you get together with people and risk reduction measures are not in place.  If you meet with others who live outside of your household, WHO recommends to meet outdoors whenever possible. Outdoor venues are safer than indoor venues because there is more air flow and fresh air. If you have visitors in your home, always maintain a physical distance of at least 1 metre, wear a mask, and open windows to improve air flow. To enhance ventilation, create a cross breeze or place a fan in front of an open window facing the outside. For more details, see “How do I improve ventilation in my home or workplace?” above.

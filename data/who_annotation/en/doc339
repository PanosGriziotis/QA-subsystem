If you think you may be a contact of someone who has recently been infected, you should be contacted by health authorities to determine if you meet the contact definition. You may also be informed directly by someone you were in contact with who later tested positive. If you have downloaded a COVID-19 proximity tracing application, you may also get notified through your mobile phone.        If you are identified as a contact, you should undertake quarantine, which means that you separate yourself from others in your household, stay there and monitor your health for any signs of illness. Some countries have set up dedicated facilities to enable contacts to complete quarantine outside their household. Contact your local health authorities to find out how you can safely quarantine. WHO recommends that you stay in quarantine for 14 days after you were last in contact with the person infected with the COVID-19 virus, but the duration of quarantine may vary by country. Check with your local or national health authority.

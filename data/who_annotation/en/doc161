Like with any vaccine, some people will experience mild to moderate side effects after being vaccinated against COVID-19. This is a normal sign that the body is developing protection. Side effects to COVID-19 vaccines include a fever, tiredness, headache, muscle ache, chills, diarrhoea and pain or redness at the injection site. Not everyone will experience side effects. Most side effects go away within a few days on their own. You can manage any side effects with rest, plenty of non-alcoholic liquids and taking medication to manage pain and fever, if needed. If you are worried that the side effects that you are experiencing are unusual, if the pain in the arm where you got the injection gets worse after 24 hours or your side effects donâ€™t go away in a few days, contact your healthcare provider for advice. More serious or long-lasting side effects to COVID-19 vaccines are possible but extremely rare. If you experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, loss of speech or mobility after your vaccine, contact your healthcare provider immediately. Vaccines are continually monitored for as long as they are in use to detect and respond to rare adverse events. Read more:The side effects of COVID-19 vaccines.

WHO Member States have developed multiple global legally-binding agreements, conventions, accords, and other types of international instruments to protect and promote peopleâ€™s health, including the WHO Constitution itself, the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and the International Health Regulations.Such instruments were created by Member States to secure and foster further collaboration in multiple areas that impact on the health and well-being of people in communities, countries and globally.These international instruments represent a commitment by countries of the world to address the health needs of their citizens to advance their health status and strengthen the socio-economic status of their communities at large.

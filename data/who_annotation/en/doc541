Adults and children should follow the same principles for safe mask wearing. Some children may not be able to properly wear a mask without help or supervision. Parents or caregivers who help children with masks should be prepared to talk about mask safetyand help children understand how to wear masks properly. If you are helping a child to put on or take off a mask, be sure to follow the same steps when you put on and take off your own mask.Children should be encouraged to clean their hands before putting on their mask and after taking it off and to wear a well-fitted mask that covers the nose, mouth and chin. It is important to not share masks with others.More information, including videos on how to put on, take off and care for a mask, can be found here:https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks

Currently, tocilizumab and sarilumab are expensive and in short supply globally. WHO and partners are discussing lower prices and improved access in low- and middle-income countries with the producers, Roche Pharmaceutical for tocilizumab and Sanofi S.A. for sarilumab.WHO has launched a call to manufacturers to submit biosimilar versions of this drug for approval or prequalification. This would allow global production to be ramped up so that more people can access the drugs.

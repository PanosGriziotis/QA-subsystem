Suspected safety events officially reported to WHO go through a series of rapid verification steps involving the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS). WHO then shares the results of these evaluations on its website and publishes the results of any assessments. WHO also coordinates with local, regional, and national health officials to investigate vaccine safety concerns and advise on next steps. Additional vaccine safety information is also made available through the Vaccine Safety Net, a global network of websites providing reliable information on vaccine safety that have been verified by WHO.

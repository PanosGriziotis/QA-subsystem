Air filters do not provide ventilation and do not replace other ventilation methods. However, they can help to reduce the concentration of the COVID-19 virus in the air, thus reducing the possibility of transmission. A MERV14/ISO ePM1 70-80% air filter can improve air quality when used in indoor settings.

Itis a regular process that WHO consults with its Member States whenproducing new estimates. In August 2021, a Circular Letter (C.L.29.2021) was shared through WHO’s official list of addresseswith all Member States requesting the designation of a national focalpoint to interact with the technical team in this process. Designated focal points for each Member State were requested to review estimates of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the data sources and methods used and, to share primary data sources that may not have been previously available to WHO. Any additional feedback is also taken into consideration during the country consultation. InOctober 2021, the draft estimates of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic preparedfor each country and the methodology applied to produce these estimates,were made available for download and accessible through WHO’s Country Portal.  TheWHO estimates of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic provide a comprehensive andcomparable set of country estimates disaggregated by sex and age from January 2020 to December 2021. Designatednational focal points reviewed and uploaded supporting data andprovided feedback on estimates via the WHO Country Portal. Nationalfocal points interactedwith the WHO Global Health Estimates team. Regional webinars and aMission Briefing (for Permanent Missions in Geneva) were organized topresent the estimates and methodology and provided opportunity to respond to any questions.

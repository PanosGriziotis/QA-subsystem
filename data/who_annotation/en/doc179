Wastewater testing can be used to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in untreated sewage.  Several countries are monitoring wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus that causes COVID-19, in a range of locations for different purposes. These include:early warning for COVID-19 cases in a community;detection of COVID-19 in locations with weak clinical surveillance;monitoring circulation of the virus during outbreaks; orto trigger case-finding in locations where there are or may be suspected cases, such as quarantine hotels, university campuses or prisons. Some countries are also analysing historical wastewater samples for evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 circulation.

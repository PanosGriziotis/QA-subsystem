When health workers are caring for COVID-19 patients, they should wear a respirator or a medical mask.If COVID-19 is widely spreading, visitors, along with health workers and caregivers, should wear a well-fitting medical mask at all times when caring for non-COVID-19 patients and in all common areas, even if physical distancing can be maintained. Health workers, caregivers and visitors must remember to combine hand hygiene with any time they touch their medical mask or face, before and after putting on and removing them, as well as before they touch them to readjust them.Health workers should continue to physically distance and avoid unnecessary close contact with colleagues and others in the facility when not providing patient care.Inpatients are not required to wear a medical mask in general. A mask may be required if physical distancing of at least 1 metre cannot be maintained (e.g., during examinations or bedside visits) or when the patient is outside of their care area (e.g., when being transported), provided the patient is able to tolerate the mask and there are no contraindications.

The manufacturer should first contact [email protected].The Prequalification (PQ)-IVD teamorganizes a teleconference as the first step of the EUL process. Thereafter, we invite manufacturersto submit an application letter if the manufacturer has conducted all the required minimum studiesin our instructions document. We prefer if manufacturers submit all information at one time ratherthan partial data at multiple timepoints as it assists us to undertake a more efficient data review.However, when this is not possible, manufacturers are encouraged to contact our Team to seekguidance. Once we receive the application letter, we will prepare a letter of agreement, and ask themanufacturer to submit their product dossier. The QMS documentation and product performancedata are reviewed in parallel. Firstly, the provided information is screened for completeness and (ifcomplete) then undergoes a technical assessment. We inform the manufacturer of the outcome ofeach step and ask for more information where required.

Plan and develop innovative strategies to ensure as many eligible people as possible can access information and contraception during this period.Increase use of mobile phones and digital technologies to help people make decisions about which contraceptive methods to use, and how they can be accessed. Enable health care workers to provide contraceptive information and services as per national guidelines to the full extent possible. This is particularly important where pregnancy poses a high risk to health.  Expand availability of contraceptive services (including both information and methods) through places other than healthcare facilities, such as pharmacies, drug shops, online platforms and other outlets.  This can be with or without prescription depending on national guidelines and contraceptive method.  Relax restrictions on the number of repeat issues of prescription-only hormonal contraceptives that can be issued.Ensure access to emergency post-coital contraception, including consideration of over the counter provision.Enable access to contraception for women and girls in the immediate post-partum and post abortion periods when they may access health services.

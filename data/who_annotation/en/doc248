The process to consider such an international accord for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response is being led fully by WHO’s Member States.In December 2021, WHO’s Member States decided at a special session of the World Health Assembly – WHO’s highest decision-making body, comprised of all of its 194 sovereign member countries – to establishan intergovernmental negotiating body (INB), representing all regions of the world, to draft and negotiate a WHO convention, agreement, or other international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, with a view to adoption under Article19 of the WHO Constitution, or other provisions of the Constitution as may be deemed appropriate by the INB.Article 19 gives the 194 Member States forming the Health Assembly the authority to adopt conventions or agreements on any matter within WHO’s competence. The sole instrument established under Article 19 to date is the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which has made a significant and rapid contribution to protecting people from tobacco since its entry into force in 2005.The World Health Assembly decision establishing the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) and its work on this new international accord stressed that WHO’s Member States, who will be working in their sovereign capacity, should guide their effortsby the principle of solidarity with all people and countries, and that the accord should frame practical actions to deal with both causes and consequences of pandemics and other health emergencies.In support of the INB process, the following four key inputs are being sought:written inputs to the current working draft from Member States and relevant stakeholders: regional consultations during the WHO Regional Committees of 2022; informal, focused consultations on selected key issues, including with experts; and public hearings (two rounds, in April and September 2022), for interested parties and stakeholders to express their views. The INB has been requested to deliver a progress report to the 76th World Health Assembly in 2023 and submit its outcome for consideration by the 77th World Health Assembly in 2024.Conceptual zero draft At the Third meeting of the INB, to be held in December 2022, a conceptual zero draft of the accord will be considered. It presents a proposed structure of the future accord and is presented as a “bridge” between the working draft presented at the Second meeting of theINB and the future “zero” draft, to be considered at the Fourth meeting of the INB in February 2023. The conceptual zero draft was developed by the Bureau of the INB at the request of the INB during its Second meeting and reflects: the inputs of interventions during the Second meeting of the INB; written submissions from Member States and other relevant stakeholders of the INB;regional consultations held during or on the sidelines of the six WHO Regional Committees in 2022;outcomes from the second round of public hearings conducted by the WHO Secretariat; and outcomes from four informal, focused consultations held by the INB Bureau, including input from technical and policy experts.The conceptual zero draft is not an official/formal draft of the accord and is not presented for “negotiation” “agreement” or otherwise to be “approved” by WHO’s Member States. Structure of the conceptual zero draft The conceptual zero draft is structured with a preamble, vision, and eight chapters, with 35 articles across those chapters. The main chapters are:  achieving equity in, for and through pandemic prevention, preparedness, response and recovery of health systems;strengthening and sustaining capacities for pandemic prevention, preparedness, response and recovery of health systems; and pandemic prevention, preparedness, response and health system recovery coordination, collaboration, and cooperation.

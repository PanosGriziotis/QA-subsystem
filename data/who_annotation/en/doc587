A contact tracing workforce can be drawn from many settings, including individuals connected with local government, civil society, non-governmental organizations, universities and community volunteers. Ideally, a gender-balanced contact tracing team should be recruited from the community and have general literacy, strong communication skills, local language proficiency and an understanding of the local context and culture.They should be provided with adequate training to ensure efficiency, accuracy and good communication skills when implementing case and contact investigations, and integrated within the wider COVID-19 response team.Several training materials have been developed by WHO and partners and may be adapted to local needs. Many are available through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) knowledge platform, and OpenWHO. Training should include the basics of virus transmission, prevention and control measures; how to monitor signs and symptoms; and standard operating procedures for contact tracing, including interview tips and ethics of public health surveillance and quarantine. Contact tracers should also be briefed on their rights, roles and responsibilities, including for occupational safety and health.It is important for public health authorities to train the contact tracing workforce when there is no or low transmission, and anticipate ways to be able to scale the size of the trained contact tracing workforce, if transmission increases.

The majority of wall or window unit air conditioning systems do not provide ventilation. They are designed to reduce the temperature and humidity of the air, and they do this by recirculating indoor air. Whenever using a wall or window unit air conditioning system, open windows for a few minutes every hour to bring in fresh air from the outside.  Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems pull outside air inside. Make sure the settings on your HVAC system maximize the amount of fresh, outdoor air that is pulled into the system. HVAC systems should always be regularly inspected, maintained and cleaned according to the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations.   If you are riding in a vehicle that has air conditioning, make sure to use the setting that bring in fresh air.

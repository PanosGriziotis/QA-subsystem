There is no evidence at this point that the Bacille Calmette-GueÃÅrin vaccine (BCG) protects people against infection with COVID-19 virus. Clinical trials addressing this question are underway, and WHO will evaluate the evidence when it is available. In the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19. WHO continues to recommend reserving BCG for neonatal vaccination in settings with a high risk of tuberculosis.More information

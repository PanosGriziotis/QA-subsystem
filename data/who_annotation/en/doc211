When you are inside, open windows or doors whenever possible. For better ventilation, open windows/doors on opposite sides of a room to create a cross breeze. If creating a cross breeze is not possible, you can place a fan in front of an open window to increase air flow and push indoor air outside.   If the temperature outside is extremely hot or cold, you can open windows for a few minutes every hour to bring in fresh air.

A booster dose is an extra dose of vaccine administered to a vaccinated person that has completed a primary vaccination series, (currently one, two or three doses of COVID-19 vaccine depending on the vaccine and the population group) when, with time, the immunity and clinical protection has fallen below a rate deemed sufficient in that population.The protection you get from COVID-19 vaccines can wane over time, evidence shows that the effectiveness wanes around 4-6 months after the primary series of vaccination has been completed. If you are offered a booster you should take it to strengthen your protection against serious disease.  WHO currently recommends that individuals over the age of 18 have 1 booster dose 4-6 months after completing the primary series. WHO does not currently recommend that children and young adults under the age of 18 receive a booster dose. SAGE recommends that high-priority use groups are offered boosters, prior to continuing the roll-out of primary vaccination among lower-priority use groups. SAGE is reviewing the available data on the need for additional booster doses to maintain protection against COVID-19 and will update the recommendations accordingly.

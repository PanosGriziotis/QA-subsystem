Identify information on local services for survivors, including on hotlines, shelters, rape crisis centers, and counselling.  Find out opening hours, contact details and whether these services can be offered remotely, and establish referral linkages.  Make these available to health care providers and easily accessible to patients/clients coming to your facility.  Support the health care providers in your facility to continue to support women survivors of violence during this time. Be prepared to shift rapidly to providing care through alternative ways, by creating effective response plans; for example, by ensuring frontline healthcare workers have phones and can charge them.  Ensure there is a protocol in place to ensure continued safe document storage in case of sudden lockdown. Inform survivors of ways they can protect themselves, and provide small credit card-size cards listing relevant phone numbers for support

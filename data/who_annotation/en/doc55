There is no known influence or interaction between antibiotics and COVID-19 vaccines. If you are prescribed antibiotics by a health professional before or after your vaccination, you should go ahead and take the full course. However, if you have a temperature over 38.5 oC at the time of your vaccination appointment, you should reschedule for when you feel better.

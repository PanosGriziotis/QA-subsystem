No. Even if you have been vaccinated, it is important to continue practicing all other prevention measures too. Vaccination does not fully protect you against infection, and you may still spread the virus to others if you are infected. WHO recommends that you should still wear a medical mask and follow prevention measures when you are caring for someone with COVID-19 infection, even if you are vaccinated. Even though the COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against serious disease and death, some people will still get infected or ill after they have been vaccinated. There is still a chance you could be infected with the virus and pass it on to other people around you who have not been vaccinated.

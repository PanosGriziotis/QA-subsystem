When taken for a short period of time, corticosteroids are generally safe and not associated with serious side effects. Corticosteroids can increase blood glucose levels in patients and it is recommended that all individuals have their blood sugar monitored.Possible complications from corticosteroids include poor wound healing, immunosuppression (which can increase risk for other infections), and elevated blood sugar, which if not monitored can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or uncontrolled diabetes. When used for a period longer than two weeks, corticosteroids may be associated with adverse events such as the development of glaucoma, cataracts, fluid retention, high blood pressure, weight gain, osteoporosis (weak bones), and mood swings, confusion, or irritation.

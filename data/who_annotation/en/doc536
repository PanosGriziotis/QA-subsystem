Decisions about mask use in children should be driven by what is in the best interest of the child. Mask use should be flexible, so that children can continue play, education and everyday activities. These activities are an important part of child development and health. No child should be denied access to school or activities because of lack of a mask.Some countries and regions may have specific policies or recommendations in place. As always, follow the guidance provided by your country or local health department or ministry.WHO and UNICEF recommend the following: Children aged 5 years and under do not need to wear a mask because in this age group, they may not be able to properly wear a mask without help or supervision.2. In areas where SARS-CoV-2 is spreading, children ages 6-11 years are recommended to wear a well-fitted maskin indoor settings where ventilation is poor or unknown, even if physical distancing of at least 1 meter can be maintained; andin indoor settings that have adequate ventilation when physical distancing of at least 1 meter cannot be maintained.  3. Adolescents 12 years or older should follow the same WHO recommendations for mask use as adults:A well-fitted mask that covers the nose and mouth should be worn in settings where SARS CoV-2 is spreading, regardless of vaccination status or history of prior infection, when interacting with individuals who are not members of their household:in indoor settings where ventilation is known to be poor or cannot be assessed, or the ventilation system is not properly maintained, regardless of whether physical distancing of at least 1 meter can be maintainedin indoor settings that have adequate ventilation if physical distancing of at least 1 meter cannot be maintained; orin outdoor settings where physical distancing of at least 1 meter cannot be maintained. As much as possible, it is important that children of all ages keep their hands clean when putting on and taking off their mask.A safe environment should be created for children who are not able to tolerate a mask, including requirements for caregivers, teachers or other adults interacting with the child to wear a mask and to be vaccinated against COVID-19 according to national vaccination policies.

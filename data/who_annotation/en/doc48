There is some evidence that being fully vaccinated can prevent infection with the COVID-19 virus. This means that being vaccinated is likely to help protect people around you by making it less likely that you will pick up the virus and pass it on. Research is ongoing to understand the extent to which being vaccinated stops you from becoming infected and passing the virus on to others. More data is needed to know the extent of this protection. There is still a chance you could pass the virus on.  Even once you are fully vaccinated, continue to practice the same prevention measures to protect other people. Stay at least 1 metre away from other people, wear a properly fitted mask over your nose and mouth when you canâ€™t keep this distance, avoid poorly ventilated places and settings, clean your hands frequently, stay home if unwell and get tested, and stay informed about how much virus is circulating in the areas where you travel, live and work.

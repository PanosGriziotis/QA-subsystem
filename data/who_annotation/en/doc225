It is important to note that other groups and countries have produced excess death estimates. The difference in the estimates produced by WHO and those produced by other groups are due to key differences in the input data used and assumptions made including how the expected deaths are calculated, the statistical model used, and the variables used to predict deaths in locations where limited or no data is available. There might also be variations of the period/month/week assessed. To minimize these differences, uncertainty intervals are provided.

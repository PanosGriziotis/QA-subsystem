WHO recommends that while vaccine supply is limited, the people at highest risk of COVID-19 are vaccinated first. This includes people who are more likely to get severe disease if they are infected (older persons and people with existing health conditions) and people who are more likely to be exposed to the virus (such as health workers). People who are pregnant have a higher risk of serious illness and preterm birth if they are infected with COVID-19, so WHO recommends that they are also prioritized for vaccination, once the first priority groups have been vaccinated. If you live in a country where vaccines are available to more people beyond these priority groups, get vaccinated as soon as it is your turn. WHO-authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe for most people of 18 years and older, including those with pre-existing conditions of any kind such as auto-immune disorders. These conditions include hypertension, diabetes, asthma, pulmonary, liver and kidney disease, as well as chronic infections that are stable and controlled.The Pfizer vaccine can be safely administered to children from 5 years of age. Both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are licensed for use in children from 12 years of age. Vaccine trials for the use of other COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents are ongoing and WHO will update its recommendations when the evidence or epidemiological situation justifies a change in policy.Children and adolescents above 5 years of age with comorbidities that put them at significantly higher risk of serious COVID-19 may be offered vaccination alongside other high priority groups.However, WHO recommends that countries should vaccinate healthy children only when high vaccine coverage with two doses has been achieved in higher priority-use groups, as identified in the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.

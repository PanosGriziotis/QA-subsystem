This multidisciplinarynetwork brings together technical experts from various fields, such asinfection control specialists, engineers, architects, aerobiologists andenvironmental experts.In June 2020, WHO contributed to guidance on ventilation andair-conditioning systems in the context of COVID-19, available  here. WHO works closely with the World MeteorologicalOrganization Joint Office for Climate and Health and the United States NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Global HealthInformation Network to develop and update this guidance.

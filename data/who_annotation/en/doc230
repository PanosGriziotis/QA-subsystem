Tier classification is a simple grouping of countries based on mortality data availability. Countries are classified as Tier 1 countries if complete and nationally representative monthly all-cause mortality data for the specified period have been made available to WHO. Countries categorized as Tier 2 include countries for which WHO does not have access to the complete data and thus requires the use of alternative data sources or the application of scaling factors to generate the national aggregate. For these countries, WHO also utilizes subnational data where available.  Tier classification is not a classification of health systems but one specific for and only applied to this current exercise. It is not a reflection of the public health advancement of a country nor of the legislation in place for mortality surveillance. It concretely takes into consideration clear inclusion and exclusion criteria based on data that have been made available to WHO.

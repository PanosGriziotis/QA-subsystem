WHO recommends that people who have been in contact with a person with COVID-19 infection should quarantine themselves if they have had face-to-face or direct physical contact with someone who has COVID-19 infection or is suspected to have COVID-19 infection. People who have not used medical masks or appropriate personal protective equipment in caring for someone with COVID-19 infection should also quarantine, if possible.Many countries and regions have their own policies about isolation and quarantine for people who have been in contact with people who have COVID-19 infection. Follow the guidance from your health department or ministry.

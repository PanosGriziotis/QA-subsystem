PQT-IVD team are not undertaking any laboratory evaluation on manufacturers behalf. However, we understand that some organisms are proving difficult to source in different jurisdictions. As long as manufacturers can demonstrate that they have made adequate attempts to source these specimens, we can accept the testing to be submitted at an agreed later timepoint when the manufacturer can access these specimens. We will review the overall dataset and accept that there might be some small gaps in the dossier where other sections have been addressed completely.

For optimal effect, tocilizumab and sarilumab should be administered as soon as possible once a patient is diagnosed with severe or critical COVID-19. Tocilizumab and sarilumab should be administered intravenously as a single dose by a healthcare worker in a monitored clinical setting over one hour. In rare circumstances a second dose may be administered intravenously at the clinical discretion of the healthcare provider 12 to 48 hours after the first dose.  Patients should have routine bloodwork prior to the administration of IL-6 receptor blockers and 3 days after completing the infusion (see the guidelines for more details).

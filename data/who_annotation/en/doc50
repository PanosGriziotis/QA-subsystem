We still donâ€™t know exactly how long protection from COVID-19 vaccines lasts, but current data indicates that most people have strong protection against serious illness and death for at least 6 months.There is increasing evidence that the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine against infection and mild symptoms can wane over time. In light of this, WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has advised that booster doses are offered to people 4-6 months after the primary series of vaccination is completed. A booster dose should be taken when offered, to strengthen protection against serious illness and death from COVID-19.Immunity may reduce faster in people who are older or who have underlying medical conditions, or who have a high level of exposure to the virus, so SAGE recommends that boosters are offered to higher priority-use groups before vaccines are given to those in lower-priority use groups.People over 60 and immune-compromised who have received two doses of Sinovac and Sinopharm should also be given an additional third dose as part of the primary series to reach sufficient immunity. A booster dose is recommended for these vaccines, for more details consult the interim recommendations.To protect yourself, get vaccinated AND continue practicing the recommended protective behaviours against COVID-19, including regular hand-washing, physical distancing, and ventilation of rooms.Read more:Vaccine efficacy, effectiveness and protection.

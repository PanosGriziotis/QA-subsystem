Globally, mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer and Moderna have been used to protect millions of people against COVID-19. A significant amount of data is available from both clinical trials and country surveillance programmes on their efficacy and safety. Some mild side effects are expected after vaccination; these are a normal sign that the body is developing protection. There have been reports of very rare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart) following the second dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Myocarditis and pericarditis can be caused by many factors, including infections, viruses, medicines and environmental factors. The currently available data suggests that there is also a potential relationship between these symptoms and mRNA vaccines. Research is underway to understand more.Cases have been mostly reported in younger men aged 12 â€“ 29 (40.6 cases of myocarditis per million second doses) compared to females of the same age group (4.2 cases per million second doses)[1]. The symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis are generally mild. Fast treatment with medication and rest can help to avoid long term heart damage and death. If you experience new and persisting chest pain, shortness of breath or have a racing or pounding heartbeat within a few days of vaccination, contact your doctor immediately. The benefits of these vaccines greatly outweigh the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis by preventing deaths and hospitalisations due to COVID-19.

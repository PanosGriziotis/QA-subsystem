No. Even after getting vaccinated, keep taking precautions to protect yourself, family and friends if there is still COVID-19 in your area. The maximum level of protection is not reached until several weeks after full vaccination. If you have a two-dose vaccine, this means that you don’t get full immunity until 2–4 weeks after the second dose. COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, but a small percentage of people will still get ill from COVID-19 after vaccination (this is known as a breakthrough infection). There is also still a chance that you could pass the virus on to others who are not vaccinated. Some people have not been vaccinated against COVID-19, cannot be vaccinated, or do not develop full immunity in response to COVID-19 vaccines because of having a weakened immune system. Continue to practice all protective behaviours to protect yourself and others. Even once you are fully vaccinated, stay at least 1 metre away from other people, wear a properly fitted mask over your nose and mouth when you can’t keep this distance, avoid poorly ventilated places and settings, clean your hands frequently, stay home if unwell and get tested, stay informed about how much virus is circulating in the areas where you travel, live and work, and get vaccinated as soon as it is your turn.

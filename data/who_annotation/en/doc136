The ethical basis for deciding which individuals or groups might be prioritized, including the principles to be applied, are presented in the below table:Ethical considerations when deciding who to prioritizePrincipleDescriptionPractice implicationEqualityEach person’s interest should count equally unless there are good reasons that justify the differential prioritization of resources.Irrelevant characteristics of individuals, such as race, ethnicity, creed, ability or gender, should not serve arbitrarily as the basis for the differential allocation of resources.This principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources by a lottery – that is, randomly by chance – or by a system of first come, first served. May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of scarce resources among individuals or populations who can be expected to derive the same benefit from the resource, for example, vaccines among high-risk populations, or ventilators among those with similar clinical indicators for benefit.Best outcomes (utility)This principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources according to their capacity to do the most good or minimize the most harm, for example, using available resources to save the most lives possible.May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of scarce resources that confer substantially different benefits to different individuals, for example, ventilators to those expected to derive the most benefit.Prioritize the worst offThis principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources to those in greatest medical need or those most at risk.May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of resources that are designed or intended to protect those at risk, for example, PPE for health care workers, vaccines for those most at risk of infection and severe illness, or those mostin need, as in the case of provision of drugs in short supply to those needing them most urgently.Prioritize those tasked with helping othersThis principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources to those who have certain skills or talents that can save many other people, or because something is owed to them on account of their participation in helping others.May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of resources to health care workers, first responders, etc.Allocation principles may be relevant or justified at different stages of resource scarcity (from less scarcity to more scarcity). For example, where little scarcity exists, the allocation of resources such as ventilators may be most justified by theprinciple of first come, first served (which promotes the value of equality). When those resources become increasingly scarce, their allocation may be justified according to a principle that prioritizes those most in need. With even greater scarcity,a principle that aims to maximize benefit from the resource may be most justified. At each stage, allocation should aim to promote equality – that is, first come, first served, or random allocation, when no relevant factors distinguish individualswithin a particular scheme of allocation (for example, among those with similar needs, or among those who can be expected to benefit similarly from the resources, or among those that are at similar levels of risk).In addition, multiple principles may be combined within an allocation scheme. For example, an allocation scheme for PPE might find its justification in a principle prioritizing those most at risk as well as a principle prioritizing those tasked with helpingothers, which would support priority allocation of PPE to health care workers.

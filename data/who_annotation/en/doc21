A variant is considered a variant of interest if it has mutations that are suspected or known to cause significant changes, and is circulating widely (e.g., known to cause many clusters of infected people, or found in many countries). There are many variants of interest that WHO is continuing to monitor in case they become variants of concern. A variant of interest becomes a variant of concern if it is known to spread more easily, cause more severe disease, escape the body’s immune response, change clinical presentation, or decrease effectiveness of known tools – such as public health measures, diagnostics, treatments and vaccines.

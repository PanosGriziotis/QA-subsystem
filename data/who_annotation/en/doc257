The working draft presented based on progress achieved for the second meeting of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) illustrates a number of potential principles for the new accord, including the importance of national sovereign rights and full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons. As with all international instruments, any new accord, if and when agreed by Member States, would be determined by governments themselves, who would take any action while considering their own national laws and regulations.Member States will decide the terms of the accord, including whether any of its provisions will be legally binding on Member States as a matter of international law. It is expected that such an accord would aim to help prevent future disease outbreaks from impinging on peopleâ€™s freedom to travel, work, seek education and, above all, lead a healthy life free of avoidable disease, as called for by another global accord, the WHO Constitution.

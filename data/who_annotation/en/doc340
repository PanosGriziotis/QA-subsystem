 The data storage for tracing apps can either be stored and processed on a central server managed by the national public health authority, or stored and processed on the users’ phones. There is a consensus by several data protection authorities that storing data on users’ phones enhances privacy, since users have greater control over the amount of information that they share with health authorities. The collection and use of such data by health authorities can therefore be limited to what is strictly necessary for the operation of a digital tracing system.Whichever approach is selected, governments and third parties should ensure digital tracing systems follow WHO guidance on ethical considerations on the use of digital proximity tracing for COVID-19 contact tracing. Protecting the personal data and privacy of individuals participating in digital tracing is critical to ensure the protection of human rights and civil liberties as well as the establishment of public trust.

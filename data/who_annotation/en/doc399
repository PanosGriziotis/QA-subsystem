Wherever you are, follow COVID-19 prevention measures, such as wearing a mask, washing hands frequently, maintaining physical distance of at least 1 metre, and avoiding crowded or poorly ventilated places and settings whenever possible.  Traveling may place you in areas that are closed, confined, or crowded (the three Cs), which puts you at a higher risk of being exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19. Whenever possible, stay in open, well-ventilated settings. While travelling, practice prevention measures even if you are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.  Be sure to follow COVID-19 travel policies and rules required by venues, transport operators and travel hubs such as airports, bus terminals, and train stations. Know before you go.

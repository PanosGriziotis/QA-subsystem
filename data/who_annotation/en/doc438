People living with HIV (PLHIV) who have not achieved viral suppression through antiretroviral treatment (ART) may have a compromised immune system that leaves them vulnerable to opportunistic infections and further HIV disease progression. There is no clinical evidence that PLHIV have a higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 when compared with HIV-negative people. There are several small studies conducted early in the pandemic that describe the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in PLHIV, indicating that the clinical presentation of COVID-19 is similar in people with and without HIV, particularly if they are on ART and have achieved HIV viral suppression However, global data compiled by WHO from almost 350 000 patients in 38 countries indicate that PLHIV are at increased risk for development of severe illness and death due to COVID-19. This analysis found that the risk of developing severe fatal COVID-19 was 38% greater in this population when compared to people without HIV infection . PLHIV frequently face adverse social determinants of health and structural factors that may lead to higher SARS-CoV-2 exposure. They also have a high prevalence of some comorbidities associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and hypertension. Additionally, lower CD4 T-cell counts are associated with advanced HIV disease and several epidemiological studies are suggesting that this HIV subpopulation are at greater risk for hospitalization due to COVID-19 and mortality. Taken all these considerations together, there is no clear evidence of a higher risk for PLHIV to be infected with SARS-COV-2 when compared with the general population. However, those with advanced HIV disease, those with low CD4 T-cell counts and high HIV viral load and those who are not taking ART have an increased risk of COVID-19 complications in general.

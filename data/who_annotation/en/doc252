As the process of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body is solely the decision of WHO’s 194 sovereign Member States, WHO’s Member States will ultimately determine the form and content of the new accord, including its objectives, principle(s),and scope. The new accord could represent a global commitment to work together, as an international community, to help prevent disease outbreaks from impacting individuals, communities, countries and the world in the same way as the COVID-19 pandemic did.Importantly, any new accord would be expected to establish principles, priorities and targets for pandemic preparedness and response, with the aim to:build resilience to pandemics;support prevention, detection, and responses to outbreaks with pandemic potential;ensure equitable access to pandemic countermeasures; andsupport global coordination through a stronger and more accountable WHO.The new accord could complement other initiatives, actions and measures aimed at making the world safer from pandemics, including the International Health Regulations and global institutions and systems working to equitably share health technologies,information and expertise.The proposed accord could take the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and use them to build back better. Equity is one of the key principles being discussed as part of the work on the new accord.A new accord could promote political commitment at the highest level, through ensuring an all-of-government and whole-of-society approach within countries, and sustained and sufficient political and financial investment within and among countries.

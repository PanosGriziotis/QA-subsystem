WHO produces estimates using statistical modelling for all global health estimates, often with the advice of technical experts, to ensure robust statistical standards are followed and facilitate global comparability. This is the standard approach followed also by other UN agencies for global estimates. The model adopted for estimating excess deaths is not a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach. WHO in collaboration with the TAG scrutinizes the relationships between excess mortality and certain contextually relevant variables in locations with good quality data to estimate excess mortality in countries with limited data.This approach takes the specificity of countries (e.g., income level, reported COVID-19 deaths rate, test positivity rate, containment index) into consideration while ensuring global comparability. Countries may have their own approach to estimating excess deaths that may produce results that are different from those produced by WHO.

A contact is currently defined as anyone who had direct contact with, or was within 1 metre for at least 15 minutes, with a person who may be infected or is infected with SARS-CoV-2 while they were infectious or potentially infectious, even if the person with the infection did not have symptoms. National and local public health authorities may have additional considerations to define contacts according to local risk assessments.Contacts should be supported to quarantine to limit the possibility of exposing other people to infection      if they become ill.(The complete definition of a contact can be found here).

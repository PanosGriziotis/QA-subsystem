Known side effects of IL-6 receptor blockers, tocilizumab and sarilumab, include potential increase in cholesterol, decrease in neutrophils (type of white blood cells), increased risk of infection (bacterial, fungal, viral, and tuberculosis), liver abnormalities, discomfort at the infusion site, and infusion reaction. In rare cases patients may develop severe allergic reactions, significant liver dysfunction, neutropenia (low white blood count) or thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).

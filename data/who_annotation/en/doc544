Children do not need to wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities, such as running, jumping or playing, as it may affect their breathing. When organizing sporting activities for children, it is important to encourage all other public health measures: Choose outside venues over indoor ones.If gatherings must be held indoors, open windows to ensure good ventilation. Maintain at least a 1-metre distance from others and limit the number of children playing together. Provide access to hand hygiene facilities and encourage children to use them.

In areas where SARS-CoV-2 is spreading, adults under the age of 60 interacting with children should wear a well-fitted mask that covers the nose and mouth when they are:in indoor settings where ventilation is known to be poor or cannot be assessed, or the ventilation system is not properly maintained, regardless of whether or not physical distancing of at least 1 meter can be maintained; orin indoor settings that have adequate ventilation if physical distancing of at least 1 meter cannot be maintained.Adults aged 60 or over, or who have any underlying health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or cancer, should wear a medical mask due to their higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19.

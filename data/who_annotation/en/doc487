A pulse oximeter is a small medical device used to measure the level of oxygen in the blood. People with COVID-19 may have low oxygen levels, which can be life-threatening.To measure the level of oxygen in the blood, a pulse oximeter is usually placed on the finger or toe of the person who is sick. Using a pulse oximeter is painless and only takes a few minutes. If your healthcare provider recommends the use of a pulse oximeter, be sure to get instructions about how to use it and how to read and understand the results, and report them to your healthcare provider. Accurate measurements and readings from a pulse oximeter are important signs in determining if and when a COVID-19 patient at home may need urgent care at a healthcare facility. As a general rule, a decline below 90%, or a progressive downwards trend, can be an early warning of need for further medical assessment.Most COVID-19 patients being cared for at home will not require a pulse oximeter.

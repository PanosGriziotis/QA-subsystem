COVID-19 vaccines are an important tool to stop the pandemic, but they will not do so on their own. Public health and social measures such as surveillance, contact tracing, isolation and individual protective behaviours such as staying at least 1 metre away from other people, wearing a properly fitted mask over your nose and mouth, avoiding poorly ventilated places and settings, staying home if unwell, covering coughs and sneezes and cleaning your hands frequently remain essential to breaking the chain of transmission.The impact of COVID-19 vaccines on the pandemic will depend on several factors. These include the effectiveness of the vaccines; how quickly they are approved, manufactured, and delivered; the possible development of other variants, and how many people get vaccinated.

In most places, you should not be charged for physical exams, testing or vaccination. The International Health Regulations (IHR) are an instrument of international law that is legally binding in 196 countries, including the 194 WHO Member States. The IHR includes important safeguards to protect the rights of travelers in the application of health measures. In accordance with the IHR (2005), you should not be charged by the country for:examinations to determine your health status;required vaccinations or protective equipment on arrival (if these were not published at least 10 days earlier);appropriate isolation or quarantine facilities;required certificates at the point of entry that show or document the measures taken to allow your entry; and any baggage accompanying you.

At the heart of WHO’s Transformation Agenda is a commitment to support countries to strengthen their data and health information systems and make progress towards achieving the Triple Billion targetsand health-related SDGs.The SCORE for Health Data Technical Package (Survey, Count, Optimize, Review, Enable) identifies data gaps and providescountries with tools to close them. Based on findings from the first assessment of country health data and informationsystems, WHO is using an integrated approach to improve public health and disease surveillance, track Civil Registrationand Vital Statistics (CRVS) data, and optimize routine health information systems, including regular and reliable data fromhealth facilities.The following tools are available to countries:The World Health Survey Plus (WHS+) is a multi-topic, multi-mode, multi-platform survey tool togather health data quickly in standardized and cost effective ways to assess and improve health.The CRVS strategic implementation plan is focused on supporting countries so that over the next five years there willbe substantial progress with accurate and timely tracking of births, deaths, and causes of death.WHO’s Routine Health Information Systems (RHIS) strategy aims to strengthen RHIS in countries throughstrengthened partnerships, improved data collection, and improved integration and interoperability of RHIS, alongwith building capacity and ensuring sustainability.The WHO Toolkit for Routine Health Information Systems Data strengthens facility data analysis throughstandardized indicators, visualizations, and guidance, while promoting integrated routing data platforms.The WHO Harmonized Health Facility Assessment (HHFA) is a comprehensive facility survey providing data on theavailability of health services and the resources and systems needed to improve quality.These data solutions enable public health decision makers to improve essential health services and better respond toemergencies.

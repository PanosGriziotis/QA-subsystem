Vaccine safety monitoring is critical at national, regional, and global levels. After any vaccine is introduced, WHO works with vaccine manufacturers, health officials, national advisory committees and other partners to monitor for any safety concerns on an ongoing basis. Specific safety concerns that arise are then evaluated by WHO and an independent group of experts (the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, or GACVS) in conjunction with the relevant national authorities. As is standard practice in all national immunization programmes, WHO is supporting the implementation of safety monitoring systems for COVID-19 vaccines in every country.Read more: How the safety of vaccines is monitored.

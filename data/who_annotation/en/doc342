WHO recommends supported quarantine for 14 days from the last contact with a confirmed case to minimize risk of infecting others. You should remain separated from others in the household for the duration of quarantine. If you cannot be in a separate room, stay at least one metre away from others, the farther the better. Make sure you have enough foodand water, and a way to communicate with others. The quarantine space should be well ventilated. You should minimize your contact with others. If you do have someone visit you during quarantine, you should both wear medical masks, keep windows open if possible and clean your hands before and after being together. Ideally, you should have only one visitor provide food and supplies during the quarantine period and this should be someone at low risk of developing severe COVID-19.Quarantinemay cause worry or anxiety, and this is normal. Thiscan also be an opportunity to take time to care for yourself. Consider reconnecting with loved ones via telephone or phone apps, watch movies or read books, exercise indoors, make crafts, or catch up on things you havenâ€™t had time for.  To help you get groceries, medicine and other necessities, ask family and friends or use delivery services.  To learn more about taking care of yourself during quarantine, watch this video:

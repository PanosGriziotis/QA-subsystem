 Mortality data to calculate actual deaths in real-time are available in only a subset of countries where reporting systems are functioning effectively, and historical datasets to calculate expected deaths are also often incomplete. Many countries do not have the mortality surveillance capacity to generate and collect data in a timely manner and these data gaps mean that excess mortality cannot be derived for all countries using standard methods.The work of the TAG has been essential to establishing the methodology to model excess deaths where data has been unavailable and/or incomplete. This methodology is still under development and will likely be revised based on Member State feedback during the country consultation process.

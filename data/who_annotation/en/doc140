Tobacco compromises lung function, and COVID-19 primarilyaffects the lungs. Smoking tobacco is also a known risk factor for severedisease from many respiratory infections, including coronaviruses SARS (firstidentified in 2003) and MERS-CoV (first documented in June 2012). Smoking alsoimpairs the immune system and previous studies have established that tobaccouse is linked with poorer outcomes for people with TB and pneumonia. Evidence indicates that smokers are more likely to suffermore severe outcomes of COVID-19, such as admission into intensive care unitsand death, than never smokers.  Furthermore,severe forms of COVID-19 or deaths due to COVID-19 are more frequent in peoplewith comorbidities that are related to tobacco use, including COPD, lung cancerand cardiovascular diseases. There is currently only limited information onCOVID-19 in relation to other tobacco products (e.g. heated tobacco products,waterpipe, cigars) and electronic nicotine delivery systems (e.g.e-cigarettes), although these products are thought to play an unfavourable rolein COVID-19 severity.

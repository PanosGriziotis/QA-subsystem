There is currently a shortage of casirivimab and imdevimab globally and these medications are expensive. WHO and partners are working with the manufacturer of this therapeutic, Roche Pharmaceutical, to see how the medication can be developed and obtained at a lower price. It is important that we improve access to this life saving medication in low- and middle-income countries  . WHO has launched a call to manufacturers to submit biosimilar versions of this drug for approval or prequalification. This would allow global production to be ramped up so that more people can access the drugs.

The COVID-19 pandemic will have long lasting impacts on the structure of populations brought by changes in deaths and births. Substantial increases in mortality in many countries have affected premature mortality and life expectancy. WHO’s excess mortality estimates are critical inputs to WHO global health estimates and other UN partners’ work, including UN World Population Prospects.The excess mortality estimates associated with the COVID-19 pandemic provide a valuable set of comparable country estimates to better understand the impact of the pandemic. It is thus of vital importance that these estimates are made available in a timely manner and updated periodically in order to identify inequalities and gaps in health information systems and civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS), which in turn will help in determining likely future vulnerabilities and target interventions.For any questions, please contact: [email protected]
